# Logical Or

# When a two data models are provided, the logical or perform a concatenation
# of the two data models. However when given a `None`, it ignore it to give 
# you the one that isn't None.

# This behavior can be summarized in the following truth table:

# Truth Table:

# | `x1`   | `x2`   | Logical Or (`|`) |
# | ------ | ------ | ---------------- |
# | `x1`   | `x2`   | `x1 + x2`        |
# | `x1`   | `None` | `x1`             |
# | `None` | `x2`   | `x2`             |
# | `None` | `None` | `None`           |
